# bugathon-challenge
**Ninjas need to find all of the bugs in this project.**  
The project contains simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are designed to build ninja skills at debugging. The JavaScript file also introduces the concept of algorithms.

* The master branch contains the final, correct version of the site.
* The staging branch is used for updating the correct version of the site.
* The display-mistakes branch contains the correct code with notes on the mistakes that ninjas will need to correct.
* The mistakes branch contains the code with mistakes that we give to the ninjas.

The HTML and CSS files each have ten errors. The JavaScript file contains eight errors.

This is just the first iteration of this type of exercise.  I'd like to see how well it goes over and gauge the level of difficulty for this particular group of kids. We can tweak it as necessary.

Please feel free to contribute ideas to how we can improve this project!
